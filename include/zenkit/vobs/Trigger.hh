	///
	/// Movers can be controlled through a set of keyframes or the animation of their visuals. If the visual has an
	/// attached animation to be used as the mover's animation, it must have the following animations which are run
	/// depending on the mover's state: `S_OPEN`, `S_CLOSED`, `T_CLOSED_2_OPEN`, `T_OPEN_2_CLOSED`, `S_LOCKED`,
	/// `S_UNLOCKED`, `T_UNLOCKED_TO_LOCKED`, `T_LOCKED_TO_UNLOCKED`.
	///
	/// Each mover is in one of three states, "open", "closed" or "moving". Keyframe `0` (or `S_OPEN` when using the
	/// visual's animation) corresponds to the "open" state while the last keyframe (or `S_CLOSED`) corresponds to the
	/// "closed" state. When transitioning between the "open" and "closed" states, the mover is in the "moving" state
	/// during which it sequentially moves between its keyframes (or runs the `T_CLOSED_2_OPEN` or `T_OPEN_TO_CLOSED`
	/// animations). Movers with their #behavior set to MoverBehavior::SINGLE_KEYS are an exception to this rule:
	/// each keyframe can individually be addressed as a state.
	///
	/// Movers are specialized triggers. Before beginning their animation, movers first filter the incoming events as
	/// per the VTrigger's rules and only start the animation if the event passes through the filters. When the the
	/// mover reaches the "open" state after being activated, it emits an `OnTrigger` event according to the fire
	/// behavior set for the VTrigger. Similarly, when it reaches the "closed" state it emits an `OnUntrigger` event.
