# *phoenix* – Documentation

!!! quote
    The *phoenix* project aims to re-implement file formats used by the ZenGin made by [Piranha Bytes](https://www.piranha-bytes.com/)
    for their early-2000s games [Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)) and [Gothic II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_II).
    It is heavily based on [ZenLib](https://github.com/Try/ZenLib) which is used as an initial reference implementation of the file formats.

Welcome to the joint [*phoenix*]() and *ZenGin* reference documentation. Here you will find information about how to
use the *phoenix* library to parse *ZenGin* files as well as in-depth descriptions of the file formats being used.

The [Library Reference](library/overview.md) contains information relevant for users of the *phoenix* library while the
[ZenGin Reference](engine/overview.md) contains detailed information about each file format and the *ZenGin*
itself.
