# Library Reference

![](../assets/logo.png)

Welcome to the *ZenKit* reference documentation. This page contains information about how to use *ZenKit*, a
C++-library for parsing file formats used by the *ZenGin*, an early 2000's game engine developed by
[Piranha Bytes][] for the games [Gothic][] and [Gothic II][].

If you are new to *ZenKit*, a good place to start is [the quickstart guide](quickstart.md). If you are looking
for information about a specific file type, the [file type reference](reference.md) might be the place you're
looking for.
