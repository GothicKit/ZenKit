# File Type Reference

The *ZenGin* uses a lot of custom file formats to store game data like meshes, animations and textures. Originally these
custom formats for specifically made with [Direct3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct3D#Direct3D_8.0) and later
[DirectX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX#DirectX_9) in mind and are thus sometimes confusing to understand or
use some proprietary API developed by Microsoft at the time. One example of this is
[DirectMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectMusic) which is used for the in-game music.

All files used by the *ZenGin* are binary files with the little-endian byte order or text files encoded with the
[Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) character set.

## 3rd-party formats

The *ZenGin* uses the following 3rd-party file formats:

* [DirectMusic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectMusic) for the soundtrack
* [DXT1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression#DXT1),
  [DXT3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression#DXT2_and_DXT3)
  and [DXT5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S3_Texture_Compression#DXT4_and_DXT5) for texture compression
* [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) for speech and sound effects
* [TGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truevision_TGA) for uncompressed images
* [Bink](http://www.radgametools.com/bnkmain.htm) for cutscene videos

For all of these, Open Source parsers are available, however some of them are no longer maintained. For *DirectMusic*
there is [libdmusic](https://github.com/libdmusic/libdmusic), for *DXT* decompression there is
[squish](https://sourceforge.net/projects/libsquish/), [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) can also decompress
*DXT*-compressed files and can read in *TGA* files and [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) can load Bink video.
