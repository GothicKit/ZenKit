## v1.2.0

Update 1.2 introduces a host of new features, mostly for the VM, to support modding frameworks like Ikarus and LeGo.
There are also many bugfixes, which mostly address issues with games files provided by mods. Notably, there is one
small breaking change which only affects users who have been manually passing `include_polygons` to `mesh::parse()` ,
as described below.

### Breaking Changes
* [33f6f6da] For performance reasons, `mesh::parse()` now takes a vector of ints instead of an `unordered_set`. Thanks, @Try!

### Features
* [69f1df07] You can now call script functions manually, pushing values onto the stack as required, by using
  `vm::unsafe_call()`. This addition was made for compatibility with the [C interface](https://github.com/GothicKit/phoenix-shared-interface).
* [637b8888] You can now register a custom default external function for manually handling the stack. This addition was
  made for compatibility with the [C interface](https://github.com/GothicKit/phoenix-shared-interface).
* [78a1c828] Added a new implementation of the VFS in the form of `Vfs`. This will fully replace the old `vdf_file`
  implementation in *phoenix 2.0*.
* [5230465d] Meshes can now be parsed without passing `include_polygons`.
* [bbec4cc1,f46144fa] Added named constants for Gothic 1/2 specific enum values in `npc_type`.
* [e481bcae] The VM now supports overriding functions in a way which will not push a call stack frame ("naked functions"). Thanks, @Try!
* [e481bcae] The VM can now report accesses of specific symbols by calling a registered callback. This is required for
  supporting the Ikarus modding framework as well as debugging support. Thanks, @Try!
* [13c929b6] Daedalus function parameters for externals can now be explicitly passed using a new `func` type,
  instead of a plain `int`.
* [a348a389] The VM now supports two new instance types, `opaque_instance` and `transient_instance`, which can be used
  to support modding frameworks like Ikarus. Thanks, @Try!

### Bugfixes
* [2c2a099c] `vm::call_function()` now properly compiles when building a shared library.
* [b4af7ed0] The `camera_trajectory` enum now contains the correct enum value for `camera_trajectory::object`.
* [fee2dd16] Added support for semicolons in model script source files.
* [ed37464c] The buffer now no longer segfaults when loading empty files.
* [68714dfa] When reading a line at EOF, the buffer no longer throws an exception, but rather returns the empty string.
* [356647d8] `light_preset` and `light` VObs now correctly support greyscale color transitions.
* [3fe0f7be] Parsing of model scripts now features improved compatibility for modded installations.
* [0e7e507d] For compatibility with mods, values of Daedalus string symbols are now parsed using a special algorithm
  to avoid data corruption.
* [9e8458ed,7e447c3e,bcb47c1b] The Vfs now correctly handles trailing whitespace in node names.

### Misc
* [4ac598e8] `texture`s can now be copied and moved.
* [1d6a3b7a] `script`s can now be copied and moved.
* [19ab9ac2] Buffer exception constructors are now public.
* [d6566d5d,bee00d13] VM stack traces are now printed using the logger.
* [3b6825b7] The element count of `c_item::{text, count}` has been extracted as a constant. Thanks, @JucanAndreiDaniel!

### Deprecations
* [78a1c828] Deprecated the old VFS implementation in `vdfs.hh`.

## v1.1.1

This update again brings many bugfixes and smaller improvements in addition to updates to the documentation.
_phoenix_ can now also be built as a shared library which should be considered an experimental feature. This update
also finally replaces the old [lexy](https://github.com/foonathan/lexy) parser for model scripts with a self-rolled
implementation.

### Bugfixes
* [03cb97bd] Fixed a stack corruption issue in the VM which could be triggered if the `movvf` or `movf` was called 
  with a member but no current instance was present
* [c6cb69de] Fixed broken VM execution flag `allow_null_instance_access` for instructions `addmovi`, `submovi`,
  `mulmovi` and `divmovi`.
* [cae1c118, f0d6751f] Fixed a VM/script bug which could occur when using higher-order functions.
* [2cd3da6f] Added checks for division by zero errors in the VM.
* [3693450b] Prevent null-pointer de-reference in `vm::initialize_instance` if the instance's parent symbol can
  not be found. 
* [1bf25106] VDF entries with a size larger than the VDF file itself are now no longer loaded.
* [5d78aa49, 4e7b8630] Fix an issues with ignoring whitespace in binary archives.
* [c7d4115f] Catch numeric conversion errors in archives and re-throw them as `parser_error`s.

### Misc

* [4e9ae25e] Move the const-ness check for script symbols into the VM.
* [c7c6b94a] (experimental) Allow for building phoenix as a shared library.
* [15cd5893] Save the checksums for animations, model meshes and skeletons.
* [16679249] Switch to a custom model script parser, dropping the dependency on [lexy](https://github.com/foonathan/lexy)

## v1.1.0

Oh boy, this is a big one! There are a lot of additions, some changes and also some deprecations here. Also, the
performance of phoenix has improved quite a bit, especially interacting with VDFs and parsing worlds. We've also made
the first steps to making phoenix a shared library by adding support for `cmake --install` (thanks @DaDummy!) which
will be expanded on in the future. Another cool thing is the new, centralized documentation page for _phoenix_ and
_ZenGin_ internals available at https://phoenix.lmichaelis.de. It's quite bare-bones still but some interesting stuff
has already been moved over.

Anyway, here's the list of changes:

### Bugfixes

* [0c29d032, 6a64eee3] Fix issues related to stack guards and externals.
* [529137d5] Fix incorrect parsing of animation sample rotations.
* [1403f5e2] Fix undefined behavior in `trigger_mover`
* [2456b7fe] Report the end of archive objects at EOF as well.

### Features

* [397bacfa, 702c8382, b7a650af, 6dd7fe4a, 57037739, 9568b8ad, db6616f4, 15396f07, 63692ad2, d855c166, 89327216] Add
  support for parsing save-games. This feature allows phoenix to fully parse original save-games from their directory
  structure. See `save_game.hh` for additional information.
* [08bcab36] Add `archive_reader::print_structure` to print the contents of an archived object as XML. This is mainly
  useful for debugging, and it only works properly with ASCII and BIN_SAFE archives since BINARY archives don't contain
  field names.
* [f789a925] Add a safer version of `archive_reader::read_raw_bytes` which takes the number of bytes to read as a
  parameter. This works since we normally know how many bytes to parse anyway, otherwise BINARY archives would not work.
* [0d0f07db] `archive_reader` now has an API to easily check whether it's a save-game or not (`archive_reader::is_save_game`).
* [30793759, b8db4092] Add unstable APIs for retrieving and visiting archive entries and objects without a schema. See
  `archive_reader::next` and `archive_reader::visit_objects` for more details.
* [a8526c34] VM external functions may now take raw instance pointers. This allows for bypassing potentially expensive
  `std::shared_ptr` copies.
* [d0ad2da0] The default external implementation now handles instances by pushing a `null`-instance instead

### Changes

* [ae776007] `script::find_symbol_by_name` and everywhere the script and VM require a symbol name parameter now take
  a `std::string_view` instead of `std::string`.
* [0bfd3cfd] `symbol::get_string` now returns a `std::string_view` instead of a `std::string`
* [0d1b976b] Indexes into script symbol values are now represented by a `size_t` instead of a `uint8_t`
* [fd0023b7] **Internal Change**: phoenix' tests are now much easier to identify and feature additional checks for
  VObs and different game versions
* [c0ace3cb] `bsp_tree` leaf polygons are now stored in a `std::unordered_set` instead of a `std::vector` for
  performance reasons. This change improves world parse times by about 6%.
* [39319e92] If the signature of a VDF files being parsed is not recognized, phoenix now throws a `vdfs_signature_error`

### Deprecations

* [32770f8d] `way_net::waypoint(std::string const&)`: This is a broken and slow API which should not be used.
* [f789a925] `archive_reader::read_raw_bytes()`: This API is unsafe and should no longer be used.
* [1df2b5e0] `model_script::parse_binary(...)`: Use `model_script::parse(...)` instead, it now supports both binary
  and text-based scripts.
* [30de6a4e] `camera_lock_mode` and `vob::camera_alignment`: Old and incorrect names for `sprite_alignment` and
  `vob::sprite_camera_facing_mode` respectively.
* [604b61bd] `vdf_entry* vdf_entry::find_child(std::string_view) &` and `vdf_entry* vdf_file::find_child(std::string_view) &`:
  Mutating VDF entries is broken, thus these APIs should not be used. Use the `const` versions instead.

### Performance

* [ebb48be2] `messages::block_by_name` now makes use of a sorted vector instead of a map lookup
* [604b61bd, 1957cbb8] VDF entry lookups are now up to 90 times faster due to usage of `std::set` to contain the entries.
* [ee00a037] The VM now uses a flat array as a stack instead of an actual `std::stack`. This eliminates unnecessary 
  heap allocations during runtime and thus improves speed.
* [f8c69354] Improve performance of `buffer` in general by about 20%
* [5bf91b45] Improve `archive_reader::read_object_begin` performance by about 7%

### Misc

* [d2b86498, 21dbecd6, bdc8bb39, b962249a] phoenix is now also compiled with `-Wpedantic` and `-Wshadow`
* [2556143e] Add support for using CMake install (thanks, @DaDummy!)
* [de512dad] Clang 14 is now tested in CI and fully supported
* [cc00c0ea] `fmtlib` is no longer a dependency of phoenix
* [16328f8a, 44a59c1e, a61ab85e, 18464552, 8196b897, 3d79c512 - 55de3c63] Add centralized documentation site for both
  the phoenix library and ZenGin internals. It can be found at https://phoenix.lmichaelis.de.

## v1.0.2

In this version, some quite severe bugs regarding model script parsing have been fixed. Additionally, this release
contains a lot of smaller fixes detailed below:

### Bugfixes

* [cbe6feaa] Fix issue in `archive_reader::read_bool` which would return `false` for any value other than `1`. This
  is not the correct behaviour since it should return `true` for any non-zero value instead. This is now the case.
* [5c1c34c6] Fix typo in `#define` for log levels (thanks, @DaDummy!)
* [15f0e4f9] Fix a bug in `archive_reader_binary::skip_opject` which caused the parser to jump 4 bytes too far
* [a3a23ce0] Fix a compilation error specific to Apple Clang in `c_info::remove_choice`
* [b3b7eb21, ff6735b7] Fix incorrect parsing of enums in `BINARY` archives.
* [17dfa5af, 3abd7719, 26f53ec9, 5c628a45] Fix many issues regarding MDS parsing. MDS files seem to have a defined
  structure at first but there are typos in original files which break that structure. These fixes address various
  typos in these files to make them parse correctly again.

## v1.0.1

This version contains patches for many bugs as well as some performance improvements in the _VDF_ and _ZenGin Archive_
parsers. The following changes have been made since [v1.0.0](https://github.com/lmichaelis/phoenix/releases/tag/v1.0.0):

### Bugfixes

* [d9357f6] Previously, only the non-`const` version of `script::find_symbol_by_name` was case-insensitive. Now
  the `const` version is too.
* [7d87485] Non-free waypoints are now correctly included in the `way_net::waypoint` lookup
* [c8c2294] Return `null`-instances from the default VM external set by `vm::register_default_external` if needed
* [ce320ad] If a default external is set the stack guard in the `opcode::be` branch of `vm::exec` is now inhibited
  preventing stack corruption
* [272c2a3] The stack guard for the `opcode::bl` instruction in `vm::exec` used `sym` as uninitialized which caused VM
  crashes if any script function was overridden
* [612b078] Fix incorrect usage of `std::isspace` in multiple locations which could cause crashes using compilers which
  treat `char` as signed

### Performance

* [88c43eb] Improve `archive_reader::read_object_begin` performance by up to 30% by using `sscanf` instead
  of `std::stringstream` internally

### Misc

* [52e3136, 21d59b8, 6bc9967] Allow using Git submodules in addition to CMake's `FetchContent` for resolving
  dependencies
* [ccf8ce6] Updated old SHA1 hash of the lexy dependency (thanks, @thokkat!)

## v1.0.0 – Initial release

After about a year of development, _phoenix_ released version `1.0.0` in October 2022. After replacing
[Try/ZenLib](https://github.com/Try/ZenLib) which was forked from [ataulien/ZenLib](https://github.com/ataulien/ZenLib)
in the _Gothic_ engine re-implementation [OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic) and a bit more than 500
commits, _phoenix_ has finally reached a point at which I would consider it to be stable enough to make a full release.

Thanks to everyone who helped test the implementation in [OpenGothic#271](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic/pull/271).
I want to especially thank [@Try](https://github.com/Try) for allowing me to integrate into
[OpenGothic](https://github.com/Try/OpenGothic)! It really helped motivate me to keep working on _phoenix_ and to make
it better!
